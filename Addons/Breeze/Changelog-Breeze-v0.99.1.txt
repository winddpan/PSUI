Tagging as v0.99.1


--------------------

Znuff:
	- Renamed the init function to BreezeInit, so we don't break something else...
	- Allowing to click "Next" if the mission failed.
	- Disabling "Turbo" mode until we can do more proper testing.
	- Let's not enable the "next mission" button too fast, this may actually be buggy.
	- Implemented "Turbo" mode.
	In this mode you can simply click on "View Completed Missions" and all missions will auto-complete and pick-up rewards automatically.
	
	This is very much "experimental" work. This is disabled by default. Do /breeze turbo to enable it.
	- Changed duration of GarrisonMissionComplete_AnimPortrait to 0. Added a debug block.
	- Checking how GarrisonMissionComplete_AnimLine works after the beta.
	- More checks to see how GarrisonMissionComplete_AnimModels triggers.
	- Removed redundant line.
