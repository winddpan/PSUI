# CanIMogIt
Can I Mog It? adds a line to item tooltips to tell you if you have learned a transmog appearance.

- If you have learned it.
- If you have learned it, but from a different item.
- If you can learn it.
- If you can't learn it (necks, trinkets, rings).
- If you can't learn it on this character, but can on another (BoE items only).
