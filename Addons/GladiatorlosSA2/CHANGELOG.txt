- version 1.17

General
* In effort to cut back on the "out-of-the-box" spam, a number of low-importance abilities are now OFF by default. Abilities such as just movement speed increases, tank cooldowns (they're already tanky!), and low-counterplay buffs are considered "low priority". If you wanted these abilities enabled, you will have to go through and re-enable them manually. Abilities that were already off by default should not need to be changed.
* Alerts in the World is now default to off.
* **Affected Abilities**
* Aura Applied/Removed: Vampiric Blood, Tombstone (+down), Rune Tap, Dash, Cenarion Ward, Bristling Fur, Master's Call, Aspect of the Cheetah, Mending Bandage, Mana Tea, Zen Meditation (+down), Aegis of Light, Ardent Defender (+down), Guardian of Ancient Kings (+down), Archangel, Dark Archangel, Sprint, Spirit Link (+down) (not the totem), Dark Pact, Shield Wall (+down).
* Spell Casting: Big Heals, Shackle Undead, Cataclysm.
* Cast Success: PvP Battle Standards, Gorefiend's Grasp, Defile, Chill Streak, Sindragosa's Fury, Mana Break, Displacer Beast, Renewal, Wild Charge, Exhilaration, Murder of Crows, Snake Hunter, Presence of Mind, Comet Storm, Meteor, Ice Floes, Invoke Niuzao, Divine Steed, Shadowfiend, Desperate Prayer, Mindbender, Holy Word: Serenity, Cannonball Barrage, Exsanguinate, Storm Elemental, Fire Elemental, Earth Elemental, Wind Rush Totem, Liquid Magma Totem, Earthen Shield Totem, Commanding Shout, Dragon Roar, Ravager, Demoralizing Shout.

A few high-priority abilities (major DPS increases, Crowd-Control, etc) have been enabled by default although current users may need to manually enable them.
* Bloodlust, Void Form (+down), Cheat Death, Cauterize, Arcane Torrent, War Stomp, Quaking Palm, Gouge, Summon Water Elemental,

* Abilities that are still using Placeholder sounds are still off by default regardless of importance. At this point in the expansion, we're unlikely to do a full round of recording until we see what the abilities in 8.0 look like, so deal with the different voice actors for the time being. Ideally, the first version of GSA2 tailored toward the new expansion will be fully converted.

Death Knight
* Removed Purgatory (doesn't appear to work, and isn't as valuable as the other Cheat Deaths).

Demon Hunter
* Fixed Sigil of Misery while talented into Concentrated Sigils.
* Fixed Sigil of Silence while talented into Concentrated Sigils.

Hunter
* Removed Freezing Arrow (no longer exists).

Mage
* Removed duplicate Presence of Mind entry.

Paladin
* Changed Ultimate Sacrifice's alert to "Divine Sacrifice", rather than share an alert with the weaker Blessing of Sacrifice.

Rogue
* Fixed Smoke Bomb.
* Shadowy Duel moved to Aura Applied in attempt to make its alerts more reliable.

Shaman
* Removed duplicate Storm Elemental entry.

Warlock
* Removed Soul Effigy (no longer exists).
* Removed Grimoire of Sacrifice (for real this time).

Warrior
* Fixed Protection's Spell Reflect falloff.
* Fixed Bladestorm for Arms.
===============================================
- version 1.16.2

General
* Compatibility fix for 7.3.
===============================================
- version 1.16.1

General
* Fixed the Drinking alert announcing in battlegrounds whenever any player regardless of faction that is in possession of a PvP objective (WSG flag, etc) begins drinking. Oddly specific bugs are fun to squash.
* ToC bump for 7.3.
===============================================
- version 1.16

General
* Added "Dialog" sound channel option.

Priest
* Fixed the missing Greater Fade entry in Aura Removed. Whoops.

Warlock
* Added YET ANOTHER Spell Lock ID, and included it to count for Friendy/Enemy Successful Interrupts.

Localization
* New strings:
* L["Dialog"]
===============================================
- version 1.15

* NOTE: I am no longer recording text-to-speech files for this addon. While we work to get all existing voice files replaced by the new voice actor, a placeholder voice will record new additions. Because this voice DOES NOT match the existing one we're all familiar with, all abilities marked with (PH) below are disabled by default. Yes, I know it sucks not having consistency. Having crucial alerts is more important. If you don't like it, leave them off.

Druid
* (PH) Added Ashamane's Frenzy to Spell Success.
* (PH) Added Faerie Swarm to Spell Success.

Mage
* (PH) Added Ebonbolt to Spell Casting.
* (PH) Added Mark of Aluneth to Spell Casting.

Monk
* (PH) Added Ring of Peace.

Paladin
* Added Divine Favor to Buff Applied.
* Moved Blessing of Sacrifice/Ultimate Sacrifice to Spell Success to stop double-alerts.

Priest
* (PH) Added Greater Fade (+Down) to Aura Applied/Removed.
* (PH) Added Inner Focus (+Down) to Aura Applied/Removed.

Warlock

* (PH) Added Call Observer to Cast Success.
* (PH) Added Summon Darkglare to Cast Success.
===============================================
- version 1.14.3a

General
* Fixed the World alert option.
* Removed the (not functional) 40-Man BG toggle option.
===============================================
- version 1.14.3

General
* Updated to 7.2.

Druid
* Fixed Typhoon.
* Fixed Thorns for Feral druids.
* Fixed Enraged Maim.

Monk
* Added Fortifying Brew for Mistweavers.
===============================================
- version 1.14.2

General
* Removed many unused sound files. Please see the VOListing.txt file for a full list.
* Removed the request for development assistance. I have someone.
* Slight tweaks to some of the option names and descriptions for clarity.

Druid
* Removed Nature's Vigil (no longer exists).
* Removed Frenzied Regeneration.

Hunter
* Removed Dire Beast.
* Barrage is now off by default.

Monk
* Removed Whirling Dragon Punch.
* Strike of the Windlord ("OUCH!") is now off by default.

Paladin
* Removed Seraphim.

Priest
* Removed Power Word: Shield.
* Changed the alert for Mind Control to... Mind Control!

Warlock
* Removed Call Dreadstalkers.
* Removed Grimoire of Sacrifice.

Warrior
* Fixed Duel. (I forgot to attach a sound to the application, so only the falloff would alert. WHOOPS.)

===============================================
- version 1.14.1

Demon Hunter
* Added non-Detainment Imprison alert.
* Removed Rain from Above because GSA can't track it and it's pretty obvious to begin with.

Mage
* Added Presence of Mind in Cast Success.
* Moved Ice floes from Aura Applied to Cast Success. This change was to allow for more accurate mental tracking of the number of spells ready to be affected by this ability, given that it runs on a charge based system. Of course, this also means it will alert more frequenetly.
===============================================
- version 1.14

Demon Hunter
* Added Mana Rift in Spell Success.

Mage
* Added Cold Snap in Spell Success.
* Added Prismatic Barrier, Blazing Barrier, and Ice Barrier in Cast Success, all under the same alert of "Mage Shield". Off by default.

Monk
* Added Strike of the Wind Lord in Spell Success. I believe its alert is very appropriate.

Paladin
* Added Forbearance falloff in Buff Removed. Off by default.
* Added Avenging Crusader and its falloff in Buff Applied/Removed.
* Cleansing Light honor talent added to "Cure" alert.

Priest
* Added Spirit of the Redeemer (active Spirit of Redemption) to Cast Success and Aura Removed.
* Shadow Covenant is no longer alerted via Big Heal.

Warrior
* Added Disarm in Cast Success.
* Added Duel to Buff Applied/Removed. I'm not sure whether or not this will function properly, I may need to change it later.
* Added War Banner in Cast Success.
===============================================
- version 1.13

General
* Fixed the new Successful Enemy Interrupt feature. Also, it makes me cringe from how often I hear it. Stop getting interrupted.
* Added the arena Shadow Sight crystal to Aura Applied/Removed.

Death Knight
* Removed Lichborne from Buff Applied/Removed (no longer exists).
* Added Death Grip to Cast Success. Off by default.
* Added Hook (Abomination Death Grip) to Cast Success. Off by default.

Druid
* Added Rake Stun to Aura Applied.
* Added Maim to Cast Success.

* Added Leap of Faith to Cast Success. Off by default.
* Added Clarity of Will to the generic "Big Heal" alert.

Rogue
* Fixed Cheat Death.

Shaman
* Created a separate section in Special Abilities for Shaman Totems. Functionality and abilities listed remains unchanged.

Localization
* New strings:
* L["|cff0070daShaman (Totems)|r"]
===============================================
- version 1.12a

Warrior
* Moved Spell Reflection back to Buff Applied.
* Added Spell Reflection Down alert to Buff Removed. This only alerts for the DPS Spell Reflection that lasts 3 seconds, rather than being consumed after 1 ability.

Sorry, I meant to do this with 1.12 but forgot to.
===============================================
- version 1.12

General
* Added Horde/Alliance Battle Standard in Cast Success.
* Added several missing interrupt IDs to the friendly interrupt "Countered!" alert, it should now more reliably trigger, particularly when fighting alongside warlock comrades.
* Added a checkbox for Interrupted Friendlies. If you or an ally are interrupted during a cast, you will hear an additional alert (the Blizzard Quest Failed ping) in addition to the normal behavior. Bear in mind that this and the Countered alert still do not work in all conditions. This feature is off by default.

Demon Hunter
* Added Fury of the Illidari in Cast Success.

Druid
* Added Typhoon in Cast Success. Off by default.
* Added Prowl in Cast Success. Off by default.

Hunter
* Added Fury of the Eagle in Cast Success.
* Sticky Bomb is now Off by default.
* Added a second Freezing Trap located in Buff Applied, this one alerts "Trapped" if a friendly player walks into Freezing Trap. Think "success", except Success could have been misleading.
* Added Flare in Cast Success.
* Added Camouflage in Cast Success. Off by default.

Mage
* Moved Ray of Frost from Spell Casting in Cast Success (channeled abilities sometimes don't play nice in the combat log).

Monk
* Added Soothing Mist in Cast Success. Off by default. Note that this only applies to the active version of Soothing Mist taken via Honor Talent (that functions like Pre-Legion SM, hence the name Ancient Mistweaving Arts) and is interruptable.
* Added Zen Focus Tea (+Down) in Buff Applied/Removed.

Paladin
* Added Crusade alert back.
* Added Unbreakable Will (Ashbringer CC Break) in Buff Applied. Note that this only alerts successful breaks - if the CC is broken before Ashbringer completes charging, the cooldown is not triggered.

Priest
* Moved Void Torrent from Spell Casting in Cast Success (channeled, combat log, etc)
* Shining Force is now Off by default.

Rogue
* Added Sap in Buff Applied.
* Added Stealth in Cast Success. Off by default.

Shaman
* Added Thunderstorm in Cast Success. Off by default.

Warlock
* Added Fellash (Shivarra Knockback) and Whiplash (Succubus Knockback) in Cast Success. Off by default.
* Added Summon Infernal (the ground-target stun guardian CD) in Cast Success.

Warrior
* Added Trial By Combat in Buff Applied. (Fury Warrior "look at me RNG saved me from certain death and I'm unkillable for a few seconds!" proc.)

Localization
* New Strings:
* L["FriendlyInterrupted"]
* L["FriendlyInterruptedDesc"]
===============================================
- version 1.11.2

Death Knight
* Remorseless Winter's stun alert now simply says "Winter" in effort to cut syllable usage and avoid confusion for veteran GSA users who may reflexively try to react to what is now a rotational damage ability with a situational stun.

Demon Hunter
* Fixed Imprison when Honor Talened. The Demon only version should no longer trigger alerts.
* Moved Darkness from Aura Applied/Removed to Cast Success. Apparently I didn't understand how this ability worked at first.
* Moved Eye Beam from Spell Casting to Cast Success (channeled abilities sometimes don't play nice in the combat log).

Hunter
* Moved Barrage from Spell Casting to Cast Success (channeled abilities sometimes don't play nice in the combat log).

Monk
* Moved Song of Chi-Ji from Cast Success to Spell Casting.
* Touch of Karma has been moved from Aura Applied to Cast Success.
* Touch of Karma (Aura Removed) has been disabled by default.
* **Touch of Karma is logged very inconsistently to how it actually behaves and, to make matters more complicated, uses the exact same ID for all events of the ability except the DoT component. I set out with the goal of writing specific logic to accurately track enemy Touch of Karma usage, but failed to come up with a solution. This change is a step in the right direction, as it will no longer alert you for friendly Touch of Karma usage, will now announce failed Touch of Karmas (if the enemy target was in Divine Shield, for example), but will continue to alert Karma falloffs if enabled for either team (which is not logged accurately to begin with, don't trust GSA to always be correct about exactly when Karma is no longer active) and will not specifically announce failed Karmas versus effective ones. The enemy monk's Karma buff on their target frame will always be 100% accurate. If it is there, Karma is redirecting. If the link is broken for any reason, the buff will disappear and the monk is vulnerable. Combat Log does not provide this information correctly.**

Rogue
* Moved Adrenaline Rush from Buff Applied to Cast Success to remove excess callouts that occur from very brief bursts of Adrenaline Rush from the Control is King honor talent.
* Moved Garrote - Silence and Cheap Shot from Cast Success to Aura Applied.
* **With new logic for alerting hostile effects on ally targets, this change allows for more accurate alerts when friendly targets are affected by spammable CCs as opposed to some alerts not occuring due to them originating from a Stealth target, or particularly bad players spamming your ears with Cheap Shot even when the target is on full DR.**
===============================================
- version 1.11.1

General
* Fixed Arcane Torrent when used by a Shadow Priest.
* Fixed a harmless error due to a typo in localization. I'm not actually sure if this was in 1.11 or if it popped up during updating.
* Adaptation is now tracked, and can be found under Buff Applied.

Death Knight
* As Remorseless Winter is now rotational with a situational stun and a lot of visual and audio feedback by default, the alert for this ability is now tied to the stun itself that applies when used with Pillar of Frost and it reaches max stacks. Ability has been moved to Aura Applied, under "Winter is Coming".

Paladin
* Fixed Blessing of Sacrifice when Ultimate Sacrifice is talented.

Priest
* Fixed Vampiric Touch backlash alert when an enemy is affected by backlash.

Warlock
* Fixed Unstable Affliction backlash alert when an enemy is affected by backlash.
===============================================
- version 1.11

General
* Version bump to 7.1.
* Purge abilities (Purge, Dispel Magic...) have been combined into a single checkbox in Special Abilities, much like Dispels and Cures. Spellsteal and Mass Dispel remain their own separate callouts. This option is off by default.
* Special Ability checkbox categories rearranged for the sake of organization.

Death Knight
* Added Apocalypse in Special Abilities. Off by default.

Druid
* Added Thorns (+Thorns Down) in Buff Applied/Down.

Monk
* Added Grapple Weapon in Special Abilities.
* Added Sheilun's Gift in Spell Casting.
* Added Zen Moment in Buff Applied.

Priest
* Added Void Torrent to Spell Casting.

* Added Gift of the Queen in Spell Casting.
* Added Stormkeeper in Spell Casting.

Localization
* New Strings:
* L["Purge"]
* L["PurgeDesc"]
===============================================
- version 1.10

General
* Attempted a fix for the "double callout" bug primarily noticed with specific Shaman Totems.
* Added support for Dispel Penalty (Vampiric Touch/Unstable Affliction) callouts that occur on friendly targets. If there are other debuffs with dispel penalites that I have forgotten, please let me know.

Hunter
* Moved Freezing Arrow from Special Abilities to Spell Casting. Also includes "success" announcement.

Paladin
* Fixed Guardian of Ancient Kings when glyphed.

Priest
* Added callout for Vampiric Touch's dispel horror penalty. (Backlash Fear).

Shaman
* Fixed Bloodlust/Heroism Honor Talent (45 Second CD usable in Arenas, because that's totally not broken at all!)

Warlock
* Added callout for Unstable Affliction's dispel silence penalty. (Backlash Silence).

Localization
* New strings
* L["DispelKickback"]
===============================================
- version 1.9

General
*Fixed Drinking with Legion water. Or completely broke it. I'm not actually sure.

Demon Hunter
**A number of Demon Hunter abilities use separate IDs for actual combat logging to the buttons you pressed. Please continue to report any other problems with Demon Hunter callouts (I suspect there are more), as I have not yet leveled my own and cannot reliably test these.**
* Fixed Blur.
* Fixed Darkness.
* Added Eye Beam (Spell Casting). Off by default.
* Added Imprison (Cast Success).

Mage
* Added Glacial Spike (Spell Casting).
* Moved Ring of Frost to Spell Casting (and added Success).
===============================================
- version 1.8.2
** Reverted the name changes made in 1.8.1. If you updated to 1.8.1, your settings may be wiped when updating beyond that build (again, I am sorry). If you skipped that version, you should have no issue. This change was made very hastily and I did not test it a thoroughly as I should have, which caused compatibility issues for localization packs, among other things. **
===============================================
- version 1.8.1

**This update finally fixes the name of the addon from GladiatorlosSA/GSA in all references to GladiatorlosSA2/GSA2. Unfortunately this change will reset your settings, unless you go into your "..\SavedVariables\GladiatorlosSA2.lua" and add a "2" after the GladiatorlosSA. This will only occur once. You may still access the menu by typing /gsa or /gsa2**

General
* Fixed a few typos in enUS localization.

Hunter
* Fixed Freezing Trap.

Warlock
* Added Singe Magic to the new "Dispel" callout.

Warrior
* Moved Spell Reflection and Mass Spell Reflection to Special Abilities. (Mass was super spammy in Buff Applied!) 
===============================================
- version 1.8
General
* Code cleanup, you shouldn't notice anything unless I messed up. Let me know if I did.
* Added "Cure" checkbox under Special Abilities to announce any DPS (Non-Magic) dispel usage. Off by default.
* Added "Dispel" checkbox under Special Abilities to announce any Healer (Magic+) dispel usage. Off by default.
* Added "Success" checkbox under Special Abilities to announce any cast-time CC that completes successfully. Off by default.
Death Knight

===============================================
- version 1.7a
Druid
* Fixed Full Moon sound.
Monk
* Fixed non-Brewmaster Zen Meditation.
* Fixed Fortifying Brew and Fortifying Elixir.
===============================================
- version 1.7
This version adds several of the Artifact Weapon's effects to GSA. Note that I only included ones that I felt were incredibly strong, or important to announce for the sake of counterplay (such as interruptable or dispellable effects). I do not intend on adding any more of these unless there is demand, or I find myself that I underestimated the impact of these abilities.
Death Knight
* Sindragosa's Fury is back.
Druid
* Added New Moon (casting, off by default), Half Moon (casting, off by default), and Full Moon (casting).
* Added Rage of the Sleeper (+Down) (Aura Applied/Removed).
Hunter
* Bursting Shot added.
* Aspect of the Eagle added (Aura Applied).

Priest

* Added Power Word: Barrier.
Rogue
* Added Curse of the Dreadblades (+Down) (Aura Applied/Removed).
===============================================
- version 1.6
Death Knight
* Added Purgatory callout, off by default. (May need testing.)
Demon Hunter
* Re-recorded the Sigil abilities. They now call out "Sigil ___" as opposed to "___ Sigil" (for instance, Sigil Silence). This change was done for clarity purposes, and so "Silence" in "Silence Sigil" would stop sounding like a Shadow Priest's Silence. :D
Mage
* Added Cauterize callout, off by default. (May need testing.)
* Added Ray of Frost callout.
* Added Summon Water Elemental callout, off by default.
* Added support for more Polymorph variations. Some may not be in-game yet.
* #GetInterrupted
Paladin
* Added Lay on Hands callout.
Rogue
* Added Cheat Death callout, off by default. (May need testing.)
Shaman
* Added support for more Hex variations. Some may not be in-game yet.
Warlock

Druid
* Fixed Cyclone for Balance Druids. (Thanks ysteria, again!)
Priest

===============================================
- version 1.5
General
* Fixed ToC. Should no longer display as out of date.
* Moved ALL interrupts (not silences) from their individual classes to a single "Enemy Interrupt" section. Functionality unchanged.
* Hidden sections without options again.
* Added CC racials: War Stomp, Quaking Palm, Arcane Torrent. All off by default.
* Added Bloodlust and its equivalents. All called out by "Bloodlust". Off by default. Get your purges on!
* Purges & Spellsteal are now off by default.
Mage
* Spellsteal has a unique callout (no longer uses Purge).
Monk
* Rushing Jade Wind is now off by default.
Rogue
* Added Garrote - Silence callout.
* Added Riposte. (Buff Applied & Down).
* Added Roll the Bones (off by default - this is intended only for people who know specifically what to watch out for when going against Outlaw rogues. This does not announce results, only that it occured.)
* Fixed Shadow Dance (back in Buff Applied). Note that it has charges now, so you will be hearing it more often.
* Still needs a nerf.
Shaman
* Call of the Elements removed. (No longer exists?)
* Separated the 3 PvP Totems into their own unique callouts (Skyfury Totem, Windfury Totem, Counterstrike Totem). (Thanks, ysteria!)
* "Spirit Link" now calls out Spirit Link, the Honor Talent, and has a new falloff callout. Spirit Link Totem is now called as such.
Warlock
* Call Felhunter merged with Spell Lock.
===============================================
- version 1.4
General
* Fixed default path for custom sounds.
Demon Hunter
* Nerfing your fun a little harder just in time for your debut. :^)
* Added Mana Break callout.
* Added Fel Eruption callout.
Rogue
* Added Kidney Shot callout. (Thanks, Vithial!)
* Added Between the Eyes callout (currently shares with Kidney).
* Added Cheap Shot callout.
* You have too many stuns, get nerfed.
* Added Plunder Armor callout.
* Added Cannonball Barrage callout. Did not miss a great opportunity with it.
===============================================
- version 1.3
Pushing this build with only a few changes due to the Warlock fixes. Seduce has been added, and I did extensive testing to fix Spell Lock which, for some reason, had a number of spell IDs added to it.
* Priest
	+ Added Power Word: Radiance to Big Heal callout.
	+ Added Shadow Covenant to Big Heal callout (not that anyone is going to take that in PvP, lol)
* Warlock
	+ Added Seduction (Succubus Pet)
	+ Added Mesmerize (Shyvarra pet, if they still exist?)
	+ Shadowfury moved from Cast Success to Spell Casting.
	+ Fixed demon interrupts.
===============================================
- version 1.2
Given that this is GSA2 and not the original GSA, I found it odd that I am still using their version numbers. This version is officially GSA2_1.2. Will be using this naming convention going forward.
* Hunter
	+ Removed Rapid Fire (apparently no longer used?)
	+ Added Trueshot in Buff Applied/Removed.
	+ Added Snake Hunter.
* Mage
	+ Added Spellsteal (called out by "Purge")

* Priest
	+ Removed Shadow Mend from Big Heal callout.
	+ Added Dispel Magic (called by "Purge")

	+ Exsanguinate added.
* Shaman
	+ Astral Shift moved from Cast Success to Buff Applied.
	+ Storm Elemental's callout changed from Storm Elemental Totem to Storm Elemental.

	+ Call Dreadstalkers has moved from Cast Success to Spell Casting.
* Warrior
	+ Battle Cry's callout changed from Recklessness to Battle Cry.
	+ Commanding Shout's callout changed from Rallying Cry to Commanding Shout.
===============================================
- version 2.4.1 (1.1)
* General
	+ PvP Trinket Class now only calls out PvP trinkets and no longer interferes with Every Man for Himself and Will of the Forsaken callouts. Class callout functionality is still on the to-do list.

* Death Knight
	+ Sindragosa's Fury has been temporarily removed due to being an artifact ability. Will be re-added in the future alongside other artifact abilities.
* Druid
	+ FIX: Incarnation suite no longer announces "down" on form shift; now correctly announces the cooldown's end. Note that repeatedly entering the same form will continue to announce the spec's incarnation - this is the only way to continue calling out specifically which spec is using Incarnation.
* Mage
	+ REMOVED: Cold Snap (Is a passive)
	+ REMOVED: Prismatic Crystal (No longer exists)
* Monk
	+ Vivify is now a part of the Big Heal callout.
* Priest
	+ Power Word: Shield is no longer enabled by default.
	+ Shadow Mend (Discipline/Shadow) is now a part of the Big Heal callouts.
* Warlock
	+ Demonbolt has been added to Spell Casting.

===============================================
- version 2.4a (1.0a)
	* Fixed /gsa
	* Changed addon to "GladiatorlosSA2" from "GladiatorlosSA_Legion". You will need to redo your settings (sorry), or rename your Saved Variables accordingly.
===============================================
- version 2.4 (1.0) (Unofficial 7.0/Legion Fan Update, ~Grit)
Major update to address issues and add support for changes related to Legion.
I was VERY aggressive about including as many potentially impactful abilities as possible. Although it's a lot to sort through, I highly recommend going through the options to filter what you believe may or may not be important. The class changes of this expansion were enormous and widespread, I didn't want to run the risk of skipping over important abilities given that we aren't sure how things are going to play out in the first PvP season.

IT IS RECOMMENDED TO DELETE YOUR "\WTF\AccountName\SavedVariables\GladiatorlosSA" FILES WHEN UPDATING TO THIS VERSION.

	* Removed many invalid spells from the options. Their .ogg files and presence in the spelllist.lua remain in case abilities resurface in the future.
	* "trinket" has been deprecated and replaced with "trinket1", "trinket2", and "trinket3" to accomodate for the different forms of PvP trinkets in Legion.
	* Every Man For Himself is now a separate call-out due to its new design.
	* Every Man For Himself and Will of the Forsaken now call out classes if PvP Trinket Class is enabled.
		+Not fully functional.
	* Added full support for Demon Hunters.
	* Added a multitude of new abilities across every spec in the game. A full list of abilities can be found below.
	* Classes without options in a category now have a placeholder space for the sake of organization.
	* All new Interrupts and Resurrections should function in their appropriate situations.
	* Added credits!
	

	SUPPORT SUSPENDED FOR:
	* All languages aside from enUS.
	* Gender Detection.
	
	BUG FIXES
	* Corrected the Monk class color.

	KNOWN ISSUES
	* Adaptation (1 Minute, automatic PvP trinket) does not call out. This is a bug on Blizzard's end due to a lack of feedback in the Combat Log. 
	* Every Man For Himself and Will of the Forsaken do not call out if PvP Trinket Classes are checked.
	* You may receive an LUA error when clicking the "Load Configuration" button. This can safely be ignored.
