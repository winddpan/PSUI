Tagging 7.1.1 for WoW 7.1


--------------------

Mike "Xodiv" Battersby:
	- Properly fix toc for 7.1 oops
	- Remove LiteBagFrame_Show calls in ReplaceBlizzard
	- Update ToC for 7.1
	- Fix bugs with options and errors.
	- Fix token frame attach
	- Fix equipset hooking
	- Stop trying to do things before variables are loaded, causing error.
	- Only update the item buttons for the relevant bag when BAG_UPDATE fires. Reduces the game pause when mass moves are done (e.g., sort).
	- Stop trying to be clever and just turn debug into an options toggle.
	- Don't have time to sort out debug, just disable by default.
	- Hide scale sliders.
	- Fix reagent bank item lock
	- Revert "Try scaling placer for bank again."
	This reverts commit 486bd94c279e761963f51c92289a4b409463b31c.
	- LM_ lol. Wrong addon!
	- Try scaling placer for bank again.
	- Layout the column and scale for bags/bank above each other.
	- SnapToPosition function name typo.
	- Fix cmd vs arg1 problem in slash command function
	- NoSnapToPosition
	- Fix a set of UI bugs with sliders.
	- OnChange -> OnChanged Controls should register their own OnClick etc script
	- Debug if you're me, don't if you're not me.
	- Drycode UI options change to apply immediatel.
	- Minor twiddles, which from experience means everything is broken.
	- Reagent bank search fix.
	- Note about item lock maybe bug.
	- Only care about player respeccing, not group members.
	- Bank itemButtons actually do use different code for the tooltip, put it back.
	- Don't know backpack name at OnLoad time.
	- Fix bank portrait and tab names.
	- Fix format error in debug print
	- Put debug into the first chat frame for now.
	- Fix /litebag debug off
	- more ipairs fixups on panel
	- Scaling buttons was a lose, undo it. Not sure what to do now. Fix some update leftover bugs in Panel
	- /litebag debug <n>
	- Fix UpdateQuality, it's not by bag
	- Fixups for work
	- Remove missed title text override.
	- More replacing ... in event handler with arg1, arg2
	- Panel.itemButtonsByBag
	- Hook PurchaseSlot to update when we buy a new bank slot instead of watching a whole bunch of unnecessary PLAYER_MONEY events. Cache of bag/slot -> itembutton mappings so we can efficiently handle ITEM_LOCK_CHANGED (and perhaps others).
	- First dry cut at scaling the item buttons, also "bag" layout
	- Add UI controls for scaling.
	- Add LiteBag_Debug
	- Fix the frame size on show again.
	- Title and portrait work. Sizing options work.
	- Port options setting to new Panel stuff.
	- TokenFrame alignment test.
	- LiteBagPanel_UpdateBagSizes on show for the bank, since it doesn't know what the bank bags are on login - only after BANKFRAME_OPENED fires.
	- Remove calls to noexistend parent handler
	- I'm fixin my lazers.
	- Need to update the bag buttons when we update what bags we have.
	- Catch PLAYER_LOGIN to get intial bag sizes from server. Fix OnHide for Equipsets.
	- Remove EquipSet debug.
	- Reconnect the EquipSet stuff.
	- Equipset fixup
	- Token attachment
	- Superficially partly working!
	- Stack trace debugging printfs. Because I'd just have to add them one at a time later anyway when it doesn't work.
	- Tab parentArray, some Replace fixups
	- Put the tabs back oops.
	- Typoe
	- Yet another attempt at breaking everything so I can improve it.
	- Use LiteBagItemButtonTemplate again for the background, just no scripts.
	- Try to support the ItemUpgrade icon from 7.1 Probably broke the ArtifactHelpBox in the process.
	- Sizing twiddles, still not right.
	- Fewer bugs. Still many bugs.
	- Fix and prune. Fix and prune.
	- Move some more banks specific stuff off into the bank.
	- Hook events on the Inv and Bank
	- Don't care about DISPLAY_SIZE_CHANGED, the original ContainerFrame code only cares about it because it does it's own frame packing. We don't care.
	- Trash the original xml, ouch.
	- Mega commit of everything that will break everything.
	- Too much python programming, forgot the 'do' everywhere.
	- Comment about panel SetAllPoints size again.
	- Iterator button update functions in Panel.
	- More Panel work.
	- Separate Panel code.
	- Move the bags into their own separate frame.
	- Open/close inventory with obliterum forge.
	- Move the ThinGreenEdgeTemplate back into the main frame.
	- Tokens twiddling.
	- Add Tokens to TOC
	- Split token frame into its own thing.
	- Can't resize while reagent bank is shown!
	- Fix reagentbank to not show slots as well
	- Fix equipset tex attach
	- Doesn't error. Minor victory.
	- New slots stuff. Probably still a bad idea.
