--------------------

Hendrik Leppkes:
	- Fix the draw layer of mouseover world map overlays
	- Update FogClear Map Info for 7.0.3.22133
	- Remove remnant of old AceDB based map data
	- Update POI hit translation usage for 7.0.3.21846
	- Update FogClear data to build 7.0.3.21796
	- Remove commented out Tanaan Jungle Into map info
	- Remove remnants of the old POI handling
	- Do not hook the POI SetPoints, its all handled by WorldMapPOIFrame_AnchorPOI now
	- Reshuffle options to take less space
	- Fix alpha value when fading out
	- Map fading doesn't have a option in the UI panel anymore
	- Update TOC to 7.0
	- Rewrite core functionality, use more of Blizzards built-in functionality to avoid taint
	Some functionality is lost due to this, like the secondary smaller map,
	instead the fullscreen map is accessible if the user wants.
	- Import FogClear data from 7.0.3.21737
	- Only hook POI buttons once
	- Fix POI hooks on Legion
	- Fix the scale of the WorldMapTooltip when the map is rescaled
	The tooltip inherits the scale of the map, which is not really intended.
	- Remove disabled InstanceMaps module, it has not been missed
