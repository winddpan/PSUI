    The System.Module is marked with `__ObjMethodAttr__{ Inheritable = true }`.

2016/12/24
    System.Collections.ObjectArray is finished, used to handle a group of same type objects, can be used to bind event handlers to all objects. The System.Collections.ObjectArray is object method attribute enabled, so it's useful to bind attribute for event handlers :

        import "System"
        import "System.Threading"
        import "System.Collections"

        class "Person" { Name = { Type = String, Event = "OnNameChanged" } }

        oArr = ObjectArray(Person, Person{ Name = "Ann" })

        -- Bind event handler to the array's object
        __Thread__()
        function oArr:OnNameChanged(new, old)
            print(old , "->", new)
        end

        oArr:Insert(Person{ Name = "AAA"} )

        -- Set all object's name to None
        oArr:Each("Name", "None")


2016/12/20
    System.Object is removed from Core, there is no need to provide a root class in PLoop system. The framework should do it by themselves.

2016/12/15
    Change the `System.__Arguments__`'s Priorty to lower and SubLevel to -9999, since it'd change the returned function, the lowest is used for attributes that won't change the contents(like register).

    Fix the multi-attribute for methods not work.

2016/12/14
    Fix System.Recycle to be a pure table manager.

2016/12/09
    `System.__NoAutoSet__` attribute is added, used to block the assignment to the object directly.

2016/12/04
    Rename `__ObjectMethodAttributeEnabled__` to `__ObjMethodAttr__` for simple using.

2016/12/01
    The attribute has *Priority* and *SubLevel* property now, they are used to decided the order of the attribute's applied process.

    Many methods removed from the *System.Reflector*, since they can be replaced by attribute's methods.

2016/11/24
    Re-design the property system, disable the PLOOP_SAVE_MEMORY(default disabled) mode will speed up the property's access by 10%-30%.

2016/11/21
    System.RawBoolean is added, only accept true/false, used for `__Arguments__`.

2016/11/10
    The attribute system support new type - System.AttributeTargets.ObjectMethod, it's used to bind info or modify the object's method(the object method is assigned to the object directly), works like :

        __ObjectMethodAttributeEnabled__{ Inheritable = true }
        class "A" {
            Name = { Type = System.String, Default = "Anonymous", Event = "OnNameChanged" }
        }

        o = A()

        __Delegate__(System.Threading.ThreadCall)
        function o:DoThreadTask(...)
        end

        __Delegate__(System.Threading.ThreadCall)
        o.OnNameChanged = o.OnNameChanged + function(self, new) end

    Only object whose class is marked with `__ObjectMethodAttributeEnabled__` attribute can use this feature.

2016/11/09
    The struct system is re-designed, the validator can be only used to validate the value, not to change it, if the struct would modify the value, it should be done in `__init` method like :

        struct "Boolean" {
            -- No check for boolean
            Boolean = function (value) end;

            -- Change the value
            __init = function (value) return value and true or false end;
        }

    The old system would cause heavy clone cost and some problem for `__Arguments__` overload system, and split the validation and modification would be more useful.

2016/10/19
    System.Reflector.GetBaseStruct is added to get the base struct of custom struct.

    The class and custom struct must be mark with System.Serialization.__Serializable__ attribute as serializable data types, the array and member struct would be checked by the system automatically, the enum is always seriablizable.

2016/10/17
    Since the users can define methods for System.Object, some methods are removed.

2016/10/15
    The System.Module's constructor's parameter is re-designed like __Arguments__{ String, Argument(Module, true) }.

    The System.Module.GetModules method would return an iterator.

    The System.Module would try to use the object's class to create it's parent modules since the class can be inherited.

2016/09/26
    System.__Base__ attribute can only be appled to custom struct type.

2016/09/15
    System.__Base__ attribute added for structs, used to set it's base struct, so the value would be checked by its base struct first. Usage : __Base__(Number) struct "PosNumber" { function(val) assert(val>0, "%s must be positive.") end }

2016/07/29
    No auto property-method binding, must be declared with __AutoProperty__.

2016/04/20
    No auto default value from type for properties if the default factory existed.

2016/04/18
    clsA + clsB, - clsA, - ifA are supported again, anonymous struct would be generated as the result.

2016/02/19
    System.Expression.Lambda is removed, System.Lambda added.

2016/02/08
    System.Collections is added to provide the basic mechanism for collections, System.Expression.Lambda is added to support short function definition.

2016/02/03
    __SimpleClass__ is added, to mark a class as a simple class, the system would try to use the init-table as the object unless there is conflict between the init-table and the class.

2016/01/20
    __Synthesize__ modify, if the property's type is System.Boolean, then Is(is) would be used for get method, you can apply __Synthesize__{ Get = "getName", Set="setName" } to apply the generated method's name directly.

2016/01/19
    Remove __Local__ attribute, it can be replaced by anonymous features. Remvoe __Attribute__, no root attribute, use `extend "System.IAttribute" now, attribute can use __MyAttr_:GetClassAttribute(cls) to retreive attributes.

2016/01/14
    Remove useless __Optional__, modify the __Require__ property usage, anonymous class for interface added, like `local obj = ICloneable { function(self) return {} end }`.

2016/01/08
    Anonymous class|interface|struct|enum can be created, like A = class { }; ArrayA = struct { A };

2016/01/07
    When define constructor out of the definition environment, can use class.This, class.Super to call other constructors.

2015/12/25
    struct "name" { {name='field', type=AnyType, require=boolean, default=Any } } supported, so member order can be decided by index.

2015/12/18

2015/10/30
