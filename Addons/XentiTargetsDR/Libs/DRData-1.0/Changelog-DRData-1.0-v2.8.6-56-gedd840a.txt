Cybeloras:

Cybeloras:
	- I'm 99% sure that the short stun category is gone now. Charge is a root now, and earthquake and dragon roar say "knock down"

Shadowed:

	- * Initial Import: DRData-1.0/ * After playing with it more, DiminishingReturns-1.0 doesn't work very well because we need to rely on order of events registered, since all thats required is maybe 20 lines to do the actual DR tracking I'll make the data into a small library to share it.
